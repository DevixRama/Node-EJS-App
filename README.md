# Node-EJS-App

This project is a simple Node.js application using Express and EJS as the templating engine. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations, static file serving, and dynamic rendering with EJS templates.

## Features
- Express.js server setup
- EJS templating for dynamic HTML rendering
- Static file serving (CSS, JS, images)
- Basic routing and views (index, show, edit)

## What I Learned
- How to set up an Express.js server
- Using EJS for server-side rendering
- Organizing project structure for Node.js web apps
- Serving static files in Express
- Creating and using EJS templates for different views
- Handling basic routing in Express

## Project Structure
- `app.js`: Main server file
- `views/`: EJS templates (index, show, edit)
- `public/`: Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `files/`: (Purpose can be defined as needed)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `app.js`).
